\section{Test Cases}

Because of the size of the data files for the \D
standard test cases, they are not shipped in the standard
download of the \D source.  Instead users are requested
to download them from the CCP5 FTP server as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
FTP site : ftp.dl.ac.uk
Username : anonymous
Password : your email address
Directory: ccp5/DL_POLY/DL_POLY_4.0/DATA
Files    : test_X.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}

where `\_X' stands for the test case number.

Remember to use the BINARY data option when transferring these
files.

Unpack the files in the `data' subdirectory using firstly
`gunzip' to uncompress them and then `tar -xf' to create the
`TEST\_X' directory.

These are provided so that you may check that your version of
\D is working correctly.  All the jobs are of a size suitable
to test the code in parallel execution.  They not not be
suitable for a single processor computer.  The files are stored
in compressed format.  The test cases can be run by typing

{\sl select } n

\noindent from the {\em execute} directory, where n is the number of
the test case.  The {\sl select} macro will copy the appropriate
CONTROL, CONFIG, and FIELD files to the {\em execute} directory
ready for execution.  The output file OUTPUT may be compared with
the file supplied in the {\em data} directory.

It should be noted that the potentials and the simulation
conditions used in the following test cases are chosen to
demonstrate functionality only.  {\bf They are not necessarily
appropriate for serious simulation of the test systems.}
