\noindent \D is a general purpose parallel molecular dynamics
simulation package developed at Daresbury Laboratory by I.T.~Todorov
\& W.~Smith.  The DL\_POLY project was developed under the
auspices of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC) for the EPSRC's Collaborative Computational Project for the
Computer Simulation of Condensed Phases (CCP5), the Computational
Chemistry \& Application Performance Engineering Groups (formerly
Molecular Simulation \& Advanced Research Computing Groups) at
Daresbury Laboratory and the Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) for the NERC's {\em e}Science project {\em Computational
Chemistry in the Environment} ({\em e}Minerals), directed by M.T.~Dove. \\
