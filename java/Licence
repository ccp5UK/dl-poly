    non-transferable, royalty free licence to use, copy, modify, and
    enhance the DL_POLY Software during the Licence Period on the
    terms and conditions of this Licence Agreement provided that:

    2.1.1 the Licensee may not distribute any of the DL_POLY Software
          or any Derived Work to any third party, or share their use
          with any third party (whether free of charge or otherwise),
          and the Licensee may not sub-license the use of any of the
          DL_POLY Software to any third party unless, in each case,
          that third party has complied with clause 2.3 below;

    2.1.2 the Licensee may not use the DL_POLY Software on behalf of,
          or for the benefit of, any third party (including, without
          limitation, using it to provide bureau, outsourcing or
          application services or facilities management services)
          party unless that third party has complied with clause 2.3

          Academic Purposes only.

2.2 If the Licensee wishes to use the DL_POLY Software or any Derived
    Work in any way except for Academic Purposes, or wishes to
    distribute or make the DL_POLY Software or any Derived Work
    available to any third party for non-Academic Purposes, it must
    obtain a commercial licence from STFC.  STFC may refuse to grant
    the Licensee a commercial licence.  If STFC agrees to grant a
    commercial licence, that licence will be on such terms and
    conditions as STFC sees fit.

2.3 If the Licensee wishes to carry out any collaboration for Academic
    Purposes with any third party and that third party needs to use the
    DL_POLY Software in connection with that collaboration, or if the
    Licensee wishes to make the DL_POLY Software available on-line to
    any third party for Academic Purposes, the Licensee must direct that
    third party to the DL_POLY Website.  That third party may use the
    DL_POLY Software and any Derived Work (whether obtained from STFC or
    from the Licensee) only if it has completed the registration process
    on the DL_POLY Website and agreed to the terms and conditions of the
    Licence Agreement for the use of the DL_POLY Software for Academic
    Purposes that then appear on the DL_POLY Website.

2.4 This Licence Agreement allows the Licensee to use only the release
    or version of the DL_POLY Software downloaded by the Licensee from
    the DL_POLY Website immediately after the Licensee agrees to the
    terms and conditions of this Licence Agreement; the Licensee must
    acquire a new licence for any future release or version of the
    DL_POLY Software that it wishes to use.

2.5 The Licensee will not tamper with, or remove, any copyright or
    other proprietary notice or any disclaimer that appears on or in
    any part of the DL_POLY Software, and will reproduce the same in
    all copies of any of the DL_POLY Software and in all Derived
    Works.

    assistance or advice that STFC may give in connection with the
    DL_POLY Software.  The Licensee will indemnify STFC against any
    and all claims arising as a result of the Licensee having made any

    interruption or be error free, or be free from any Harmful Element.
    STFC is not obliged to provide any support or error correction
    service, assistance or advice in relation to the DL_POLY Software,
    but the Licensee may access any error corrections and on-line
    assistance that STFC chooses to make available on the DL_POLY
    Website from time to time.  If STFC does provide that sort of
    service, assistance or advice, subject to clause 3.7, STFC will not
    be liable for any loss or damage suffered by the Licensee as a
    result.

3.3 STFC will not be liable to the Licensee to the extent that any loss
    or damage is caused: by the Licensee's failure to implement, or the
    Licensee's delay in implementing, any correction or advice
    in relation to the DL_POLY Software that STFC has made available
    on the DL_POLY Website; or by the Licensee's failure to acquire a
    licence of and to implement any new release or version of the
    DL_POLY Software that would have remedied or mitigated the effects
    of any error, defect, bug or deficiency in the DL_POLY Software.

3.4 The Licensee acknowledges that proper use of the DL_POLY Software
    and any Derived Work is dependent on the Licensee, its employees
    and students exercising proper skill and care in inputting data and
    interpreting the output provided by the DL_POLY Software or that
    Derived Work.  STFC will not be liable for the consequences of
    decisions taken by the Licensee or any other person on the basis of
    that output.  STFC does not accept any responsibility for any use
    which may be made by the Licensee of that output, nor for any
    reliance which may be placed on that output, nor for advice or
    information given in connection with that output.

    DL_POLY Software, will not extend to any incidental or
    consequential damages or losses, or any loss of profits, loss of
    revenue, loss of data, loss of contracts or opportunity, whether
    direct or indirect, even if the Licensee has advised STFC of the
    possibility of those losses arising or if they were or are within
    STFC's contemplation.

3.6 Subject to clause 3.7, the aggregate liability of STFC for any
    and all breaches of this Licence Agreement, any negligence or
    arising in any other way out of the subject matter of this Licence

    total £5,000.

3.7 Nothing in this Licence Agreement limits or excludes STFC's
    liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence or
    for any fraud, or for any sort of liability that, by law, cannot be
    limited or excluded.

3.8 The express undertakings and given by STFC in this Licence
    Agreement and the terms of this Licence Agreement are in lieu of
    all warranties, conditions, terms, undertakings and obligations on
    the part of STFC, whether express or implied by statute, common
    law, custom, trade usage, course of dealing or in any other way.
    All of these are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.
