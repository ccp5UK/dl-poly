Standard Test Cases for DL_POLY_4
----------------------------------

Because of the size of the data files for the DL_POLY_4
standard test cases, they are not shipped in the standard
download of the DL_POLY_4 source.  Instead, users are requested
to download them from the CCP5 FTP server as follows:

FTP site : ftp.dl.ac.uk
Username : anonymous
Password : your email address
Directory: ccp5/DL_POLY/DL_POLY_4.0/DATA
Files    : test_X.tar.gz

where `_X' stands for the test case number.

Remember to use the BINARY data option when transferring these
files.

Unpack the files in the `data' subdirectory using firstly
`gunzip' to uncompress them and then `tar -xf' to create the
`TEST_X' directory.
