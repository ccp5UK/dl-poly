    + simplified estimates of mxatms' initial guess, local and domain particle densities in read\_config

    + improved accounting of buffer space demand for export, deport and shared units routines
    + increased demand for mxbond and mxangl to account for link cell per domain scenario

  + improved set-up, feedback interaction with SPME gridding and user advice for the 'rpad' ('delr') option and its automated application for conditional updates of the Verlet Neighbour List (set\_bounds).
