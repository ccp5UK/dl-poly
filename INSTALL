Reasonable Expectations for Compiling DL_POLY_4
-----------------------------------------------
The trends in software evolution are of increasing methodological
complexity, ever expanding user-base with widening expectations and
even more diverse requirements in the complex space of platforms
(hardware+OS+compiler+MPI+openMP) that varies considerably both in
time and geographically.

Thus we have set on the common sense expectation that a modern, user
supported platform will not have less than 4 year old OS components -
cmake3.0+, gcc4.5+, gnu make4.0+ and MPI3+.

Well, if that is the case then all that you need to compile DL_POLY_4
from source is:

THE CMAKE WAY:
-------------

	wget ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/ccp5/DL_POLY/TRANSFERS/dl_poly_4.09.zip
	rm -rf dl_poly.4.09
	unzip dl_poly_4.09.zip
	cd dl_poly.4.09
	mkdir mybuild ; cd mybuild
	cmake .. ; make -j 10
	ls -haltr bin

Usually, life is not that simple.  Anything below the above assumptions
spells risks and will requires some extent of professional expertise
and testing to make sure things work.

However, the old ``make'' way warrants a fall-back to 2003 standards:
gcc4.2+ (due to TR15581), gnu make3.8+ and MPI1.1+MPI-I/O.

THE PARALLEL MAKE WAY:
---------------------

	wget ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/ccp5/DL_POLY/TRANSFERS/dl_poly_4.09.zip
	rm -rf dl_poly.4.09
	unzip dl_poly_4.09.zip
	cd dl_poly.4.09/source
	ln -s ../build/Makefile_MPI Makefile
	make FCFLAGS=-DOLDMPI hpc
	ls -haltr bin

THE SERIAL MAKE WAY:
-------------------

	wget ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/ccp5/DL_POLY/TRANSFERS/dl_poly_4.09.zip
	rm -rf dl_poly.4.09
	unzip dl_poly_4.09.zip
	cd dl_poly.4.09/source
	ln -s ../build/Makefile_SRL2 Makefile
	make FCFLAGS=-DSERIAL gnu
	ls -haltr bin

If all above fails for you then read the manual or ask your supervisor
for help.

Good luck,
