=================================

About 
-----

DL_POLY_4 is a general purpose parallel molecular dynamics simulation package
developed at Daresbury Laboratory by I.T. Todorov & W. Smith. The
DL_POLY project was developed under the auspices of the Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for the EPSRC's
Collaborative Computational Project for the Computer Simulation of
Condensed Phases (CCP5), the Computational Chemistry & Application
Performance Engineering Groups (formerly Molecular Simulation &
Advanced Research Computing Groups) at Daresbury Laboratory and the
Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for the NERC's eScience
project Computational Chemistry in the Environment (eMinerals),
directed by M.T. Dove.
DL_POLY_4 is developed worlwide and distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0.
