    terms and conditions of this Licence Agreement provided that:
    2.1.1 the Licensee may not distribute any of the DL_POLY_4 Software
          or any Derived Work to any third party, or share their use
          with any third party (whether free of charge or otherwise),
          and the Licensee may not sub-license the use of any of the

    2.1.2 the Licensee may not use the DL_POLY_4 Software on behalf of,
          or for the benefit of, any third party (including, without
