It is shown that a slight modification to the algorithm is required before the Gibbs distribution is recovered as the stationary solution to the Fokker-Planck equation. The temperature of the system is then directly related to the noise amplitude by means of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. However, the correspondingly modified, discrete DPD algorithm is only found to obey these predictions if the length of the time step is sufficiently reduced. This indicates the importance of time discretisation in DPD.},

	abstract     = {Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) does not conserve energy and this precludes its use in the study of thermal processes in complex fluids. We present here a generalization of DPD that incorporates an internal energy and a temperature variable for each particle. The dissipation induced by the dissipative forces between particles is invested in raising the internal energy of the particles. Thermal conduction occurs by means of (inverse) temperature differences. The model can be viewed as a simplified solver of the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and opens up the possibility of studying thermal processes in complex fluids with a mesoscopic simulation technique.},

	abstract     = {The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in com- putational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dy- namics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias po- tentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The in- termediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures.}

The result is a Galilean invariant thermostat that conserves momentum and enhances viscosity. It therefore displays the same characteristics as DPD. Our method differs primarily in that it satisfies detailed balance by construction. If a simple scheme is used to solve the equations of motion the thermostat does not disturb the equilibrium properties of the system, regardless of the time step. We illustrate the properties of the model by describing the results of various tests on the analogous system to the dissipative ideal gas. We show that with an appropriate choice of parameters it is practical to make the viscosity orders of magnitude greater than the diffusion coefficient. This is a criterion that should be satisfied if one is interested in studying the dynamics of mesoscopic systems.},

This paper calculates the equilibrium and transport properties (viscosity, self-diffusion) of the thermostated DPD fluid explicitly in terms of the system parameters. It is demonstrated that temperature gradients cannot exist, and that there is therefore no heat conductivity. Starting from the $N$-particle Fokker-Planck, or Kramers equation, we prove an $H$ theorem for the free energy, obtain hydrodynamic equations, and derive a nonlinear kinetic equation (the Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann equation) for the single-particle distribution function. This kinetic equation is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method. The analytic results are compared with numerical simulations.},

This is an important feature in mesoscopic modeling, since it ensures a realistic length and time scale separation in coarse-grained models. We consider in detail the behavior of a van der Waals fluid and a binary mixture with a miscibility gap. We discuss the physical implications of having a single length scale characterizing the interaction range, in particular for the interfacial properties.},

	abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel thermostat applicable to any particle-based dynamic simulation. Each pair of particles is thermostated either (with probability $P$) with a pairwise Lowe-Andersen thermostat [C. P. Lowe, Europhys. Lett. \textbf{47}, 145 (1999)] or (with probability $1-P$) with a thermostat that is introduced here, which is based on a pairwise interaction similar to the Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat. When the pairwise Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat dominates (low $P$), the liquid has a high diffusion coefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe\BFAndersen thermostat dominates, the diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel Nos\'{e}-Hoover-Lowe-Andersen thermostat is Galilean invariant and preserves both total linear and angular momentum of the system, due to the fact that the thermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive and central. We show by simulation that this thermostat also preserves hydrodynamics. For the (noninteracting) ideal gas at $P=0$, the diffusion coefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for $P>0$ it has a finite value. By adjusting probability $P$, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders of magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), while the equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced. The thermostat is easy to implement and offers a computational efficiency better than (DPD), with better temperature control and greater flexibility in terms of adjusting the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of the simulated system. Applications of this thermostat include all standard molecular dynamic simulations of dense liquids and solids with any type of force field, as well as hydrodynamic simulation of multiphase systems with largely different bulk viscosities, including surface viscosity, and of dilute gases and plasmas.},

	abstract     = {Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is a mesoscopic simulation method for studying hydrodynamic behavior of complex fluids. Ideally, a mesoscopic model should correctly represent the thermo- and hydrodynamic properties of a real system beyond certain length and time scales. Traditionally defined DPD quite successfully mimics hydrodynamics, but is not flexible enough to accurately describe the thermodynamics of a real system. The so-called "multibody" DPD (MDPD) is a pragmatic extension of the classical DPD that allows one to prescribe the thermodynamic behavior of a system with only a small performance impact. Here we present a practical improvement to the "multibody" DPD model and test it on a number of single-component examples. We also generalize MDPD to multicomponent systems, which are an important target of DPD studies. The improved model provides a correction for particle correlations in strongly nonideal systems that were neglected in the original MDPD model. The implications of the coarse-graining procedure on the MDPD are discussed.},
