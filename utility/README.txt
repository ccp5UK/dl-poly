The `utility' Sub-directory

This sub-directory stores all the utility subroutines, functions and
programs in the DL_POLY package, together with examples of data.  The
various routines in this sub-directory are documented in the DL_POLY
manual.  Users who devise their own utilities are advised to store
them in the `utility' sub-directory.

Users of these utilities should note that they have often been written
with specific applications in mind.  It is therefore sometimes the
case that they do not work with equal proficiency in other application
areas.  Users should therefore regard these as `examples' to be
adapted to suit different circumstances.
